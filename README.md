### Demand Forecasting Project ###

Project description:

Using the data that can be downloaded from assignment “Project” at Quercus, you will have to develop a working program that accepts user inputs including (1) client, (2) material and (3) date, and forecast future demand in response to the input. The output is the forecasted demand of the material from the client on the given date. Note that

1. If client is not given, please forecast aggregate demand for the given material from all clients on the given future date

2. When material is not given, please forecast aggregate demand for all the materials from the given client on the given future date

The forecast should be based on at least two different methods: one covered by the course and another that you study on your own. The program outputs two forecasts for the two methods.
